            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>I pledge allegiance to my stuff | bemorewithless.com</h1><p>In this podcast episode on finances by The Minimalists, Joshua and Ryan discuss an article by Life Edited&apos;s David Friedlander called Minimalism: class, fetishes and the fate of the planet. In the article, he shares one of my favorite quotes: &quot;Stuff is not passive. Stuff wants your time, attention, allegiance.</p><img src="http://bemorewithless.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/stuffbruno.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>An Ivy League professor who spent 4 months working in a South Bronx check-cashing store says we&apos;re getting it all wrong</h1><p>University of Pennsylvania professor Lisa Servon went to work as a teller at a check-cashing store to find out why customers use the service. * Prevailing wisdom holds that customers would be better served by using a bank.

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Your Purchases Can&apos;t Buy You Class</h1><p>Another Monday, another post chock-full of middle class goodness. The notion that our economic class is defined, not by our income or our wealth, but by our purchases, is fairly prevalent. If you own a house, or a second car, and take the family on a vacation now and again, maybe that means you&apos;re middle class.</p><img src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-UfGBFuDleko/WARps4fbV8I/AAAAAAAAx5Y/RXdIkagPk9sn4ah53ZMTx4DAeicNOszFgCLcB/w1200-h630-p-nu/Brett%2BVA%2Bat%2BFlickr.jpg"></article>]]></description>
