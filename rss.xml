            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Don&apos;t Rely On Savings</h1><p>Savings is something sacred that you need to build up and guard against loss.

If you own a house, or a second car, and take the family on a vacation now and again, maybe that means you&apos;re middle class.</p><img src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-UfGBFuDleko/WARps4fbV8I/AAAAAAAAx5Y/RXdIkagPk9sn4ah53ZMTx4DAeicNOszFgCLcB/w1200-h630-p-nu/Brett%2BVA%2Bat%2BFlickr.jpg"></article>]]></description>
